# Oneiroi

*It’s not just a dream. It’s a world.*

You are the quiet observer of your own nocturnal theater. The silent cartographer of landscapes that bloom and dissolve in the span of a night. Oneiroi is the ink for your invisible maps, a vessel for the echoes of your subconscious.

This is a place to hold your dreams, not as fleeting memories, but as living artifacts. To see them not as nonsense, but as conversations with a deeper self.

**What you will find here:**

*   **Transcribe the whispers.** Give your dreams form and weight before they fade with the morning light.
*   **Consult the oracle.** Uncover the patterns in your personal mythology through a Jungian lens. The archetypes, the shadows, the symbols that speak a language older than words.
*   **Behold the vision.** Summon the images that haunt your sleep. See the face of the ghost, the architecture of the sky-city, the texture of the impossible flower.
*   **Chart your own fate.** Discover the tarot card hidden within your dream. Each vision, a new arcanum in the unfolding story of you.

Your dreams are not random. They are a compass, pointing toward the person you are becoming.

Don’t let them vanish.
